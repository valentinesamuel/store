Made for runners, the futuristic technology was quickly adopted by the street, bringing this light-as-air feeling to the masses."

Immediately I could tell the comfort was not like other shoes, they feel incredible. I actually said 'woah!'' out loud after running my first steps! I have tried many comfort shoes from nike over the years and these are by far the best, no question. Unfortunately, I cannot wear these anymore because the shoe is very narrow, particularly around the pinky toe area. My pinky toe is pressed tight against the side of the shoe. Towards the end of my run it was in pain due to this that lasted for days. This only happened on my right foot, so I assume this is a me problem. I am a big Nike shoe person and I have never experienced this issue with any nike shoes in my lifetime. I am very bummed because I was excited to use these as my long/recovery run shoe. I am not giving up on them yet, will try and see if I can widen them somehow because that's how good they are. I also want to point out that after my single run, the fabric on the outsides of the ankle support were getting frayed and coming apart on both shoes. This is unacceptable in my opinion, I wore these for two hours!",

When it came to the Infinity React 2s I didn't enjoy them for running and resorted to using them for work and casual wear which they were fantastic for. When it came to running I resorted to the Invincible Runs last year. With the Infinity React 3s I have enjoyed the small additional foam and how its softer. These have actually prevented me from buying and keeping a pair of Invincible Runs since they are softer and bouncier and better for me when running. The top material change to a softer style which is almost sock like which is wonderful. I also like how these are durable enough for other work outs besides running and keep their look/design for casual wear and work wear. Going forward if there were any changes I would make to these its the toe area could use a little bit more foam and the collar around the ankle would be better if it was like the Infinity Phantoms collar. Looking forward to the other colorways I might be able to get to go with my two pair.",

Also very flexible almost like a Nike Free Run shoe. The boot is very comfortable and true to size. One thing that i'm not too sure about, is how thin the material is in the toe area. I feel like over time, this could be a durability issue. I also don't see how this can be a water resistant boot, but only time will tell if I am wrong. Overall this is a great boot and probably my favorite of all time. I have listed the PROS and CONS below. PROS: -Lightweight -Comfortable -True fit -Looks great -Flexible Boot (Like a Free Run almost) -Good tread CONS: -Durability in the toe area could be an issue. Time will tell. -Water Resistance questionable. Time will tell. (Cons are only based on my opinion. I have not tested this boot to the fullest and would not base your purchase on these cons. I believe overall this is a great boot. You can always return the boot within 30 days if you are not satisfied.)",

However, on the olive version the laces are different than the black canvas (which comes with waxed laces). The olive ones you HAVE to double knot them because no matter what way you tie them otherwise, they'll come untied within 5 minutes of walking around. That is my only complaint. but comfort and style wise these are on point and fit TTS.",
