Immediately I could tell the comfort was not like other shoes, they feel incredible. I actually said 'woah!'' out loud after running my first steps! I have tried many comfort shoes from nike over the years and these are by far the best, no question. Unfortunately, I cannot wear these anymore because the shoe is very narrow, particularly around the pinky toe area. My pinky toe is pressed tight against the side of the shoe. Towards the end of my run it was in pain due to this that lasted for days. This only happened on my right foot, so I assume this is a me problem. I am a big Nike shoe person and I have never experienced this issue with any nike shoes in my lifetime. I am very bummed because I was excited to use these as my long/recovery run shoe. I am not giving up on them yet, will try and see if I can widen them somehow because that's how good they are. I also want to point out that after my single run, the fabric on the outsides of the ankle support were getting frayed and coming apart on both shoes. This is unacceptable in my opinion, I wore these for two hours!",

When it came to the Infinity React 2s I didn't enjoy them for running and resorted to using them for work and casual wear which they were fantastic for. When it came to running I resorted to the Invincible Runs last year. With the Infinity React 3s I have enjoyed the small additional foam and how its softer. These have actually prevented me from buying and keeping a pair of Invincible Runs since they are softer and bouncier and better for me when running. The top material change to a softer style which is almost sock like which is wonderful. I also like how these are durable enough for other work outs besides running and keep their look/design for casual wear and work wear. Going forward if there were any changes I would make to these its the toe area could use a little bit more foam and the collar around the ankle would be better if it was like the Infinity Phantoms collar. Looking forward to the other colorways I might be able to get to go with my two pair.",

Also very flexible almost like a Nike Free Run shoe. The boot is very comfortable and true to size. One thing that i'm not too sure about, is how thin the material is in the toe area. I feel like over time, this could be a durability issue. I also don't see how this can be a water resistant boot, but only time will tell if I am wrong. Overall this is a great boot and probably my favorite of all time. I have listed the PROS and CONS below. PROS: -Lightweight -Comfortable -True fit -Looks great -Flexible Boot (Like a Free Run almost) -Good tread CONS: -Durability in the toe area could be an issue. Time will tell. -Water Resistance questionable. Time will tell. (Cons are only based on my opinion. I have not tested this boot to the fullest and would not base your purchase on these cons. I believe overall this is a great boot. You can always return the boot within 30 days if you are not satisfied.)",

However, on the olive version the laces are different than the black canvas (which comes with waxed laces). The olive ones you HAVE to double knot them because no matter what way you tie them otherwise, they'll come untied within 5 minutes of walking around. That is my only complaint. but comfort and style wise these are on point and fit TTS.",

These sneakers are better than tying my shoes, but they're a little tough to operate if you haven't precisely put your foot on the back to get them off. Also, the toe box is too narrow for all-the-time comfort. I'm seeing them as only good for this temporary time, which is a bummer because there's lots of times where I could use an easy-in-out shoe for taking the dog around the block. Also, would love if they could create a model that works with orthotics. Overall fit is right in length but narrow in width.",

There is little give and actually gets very narrow. These can not be worn with braces, specialty socks or with wide feet. You need to have a very narrow foot. I tried them on (2 sizes smaller then the shoe size) and I could barely get my toes into and past the point where it narrows. Bummed about the sizing on these.

At first I was hopeful because there is finally an accessible sneaker specifically catered to leg braces. but, when I tried these shoes on they were the same size as a different pair I have that fit perfectly. However the length and width was very disproportionate. I could barely get it around the width of my brace and when I did there was a ton of gapping and sinking in the toe of the shoe. I hope that this comment helps Nike and other companies to modify how they make shoes. For me personally, I need shoes with a WIDE if not EXTRA WIDE width shoe. Of topic, I need the wide width and toe in boots especially. Opening the shoe is not the issue, it’s the width.",

The shoe seems to have a sweet spot when landing with a mid-foot or slightly forefoot landing.

I went to a huge music festival in Ohio this past week. Weather was super weird and some of the terrain was wet and muddy. These boots kept my feet so warm and dry. Better yet, they are SO comfortable. My feet usually tire out super quickly at festivals. By the second day it usually hurts to walk. 5 days in to a week long trek making nearly 20,000 steps a day and my feet barely hurt at all. I had unlimited energy for walking, which really allowed me to enjoy the full festival, which I’ve never been able to do before due to foot pain. These boots handle incredibly rocky and hilly terrain extremely well. Important also to note that there was no break in period. I only wore them twice before the festival. Amazing. 10/10 recommend.",

I'm an EU 36 narrow and the 6 was just snug enough to be uncomfortable after a little bit of wear. The toe split is where I felt the most discomfort, but I could feel my heel going over the insoles as well. I exchanged for a 7 and to my complete disappointment, those were way too big to be comfortable in this style. This is the kind of shoe that would be best if it fits perfectly so it feels like you're really not wearing much at all but you get the awesome benefits of the design. If they made these in half sizes I would be over the moon, they really were so close to perfect.",

I did not think that it was extraordinary or anything but I did note that it was thicker than most other Nike shoes which I suppose provides slightly more comfort than other running shoes. I bought these shoes for nursing school since I needed comfortable white shoes. I did not want to buy the Pegasus line in white since I do not plan to use it past school since I do not like white shoes. Nonetheless, this shoe was definitely not fully white, but more of an eggshell off colored white. While I personally just need to fulfil dress code requirements, this did bother me as the pictures make the shoe look blinding white. Also, the side details appear to be mesh since you can see the sock color I wear through it. It is not completely see-through, but it does show the color of the sock. The shoe overall gives good stability for your foot and is comfortable to walk around it but does not feel entirely different to the Pegasus line in terms of long-wear comfort. The size it just right as my foot is a 7.5 and I gambled and ordered 7.5 and have no issues with it. If you want more toe room and wear thicker socks then it might be a good idea to size up a half size but otherwise, I find that it had correct sizing. Overall, not a bad shoe, just not the \"I'm walking on clouds\" feeling everyone else is describing.",

That is my favorite part of the shoe and there was finally a nice, rich, neon orange available (vs the pale orange).The velcro style closure adds bulk which I don't like, but what really doesn't appeal to me is the way the top of the shoe lays after its fastened. The shape is odd and uncomfortable, and the center ribbon with my personalized text looks off-centered. Comfort is just okay, the slip-on flyknits have more cushioning. I'll stick to those. It would be great if those could be customized.",

The shoe runs sightly big, but once I but a thick sock on with them they fit fine. I love how the shoe doesn’t have shoestrings that you tie up, instead a velcro strap that keeps your foot tight and snugged in the shoe. You just put your foot in and go. I’m a sprinter, it felt so good running in them and not once did the strap loosen. Also, the sole of the shoe is very thick and gives you a little height. Although the sole of the shoe is thick the shoe is very light. Even if your not a runner I would recommend these shoes as a every day shoe because of the comfort.",

The color is a highlighter yellow with blue accents. I'm not usually a fan of very brightly colored shoes but I was really into these because the color fades out towards the toes and they were just really sharp looking. The laces are a good material, not too slippery so they stay put but easy on the fingers and sleek looking to fit with the rest of the shoes style. The material is lightweight, breathable, has a little give, no seams digging in and is overall very comfortable feeling. I have another style made out of this material and they've held up really well for a few years now so I anticipate these will do the same. They feel supportive enough for running or jogging but aren't too bulky for walking or casual wear. As for fit, unfortunately they run on the small side. I typically wear an women's 8 but sometimes need an 8.5 these days. I got the woman's 8 and they were a bit too tight for me to keep. I would definitely recommend choosing a size up if you're on the upper end of your usual size or between sizes. I have ever so slightly narrow width feet and found the toe space to be pretty average. I really enjoyed these sneakers and will definitely get them in a size up.",

I have a difficult time finding running shoes that don’t slip in the heel and/or have good arch support. I have at least 5 pair of Nikes that sit in my closet, rarely worn. Enter the Nike Air Zoom Alphafly Flyknit! Holy moly these feel amazing! They have a heel no-slip pad and amazing support. I want to wear them all the time! I don’t like the color combination though - wish the mid-sole was black instead of white. It’s distracting. Because my arch is so high, it’s a challenge putting these on. I need a shoe horn. But once they are on … perfect fit.",

I always wear 8 men and 9 1/2 women. True to size. I highly recommend them. It arrived fast as usual and looks like from our local Miami store. I didn’t even have to take a drive.

I have about 75 miles on my current pair but I can tell the uppers are already more durable than the TK6 and TK7. I run on a lot of sandy trails and these keep the sand out better than my old pairs. The traction is also much improved for rocky terrain. I love these shoes for hill repeats and even long trail runs (I’ve done up to 13 miles so far). I just wish there were more colors available!",

                    "comment": "For starters, these shoes are obviously for a very specific purpose - they'll be worn for short periods of time during practice or competition, and that's about it. Because of that, I had fairly low expectations when it came to comfort, build quality, and even in how event-specific these shoes would really be. These really exceeded my expectations in all of those areas. They're incredibly well built - high quality materials, bulletproof construction, and a great, snug fit. They fit true to size - I have average width 10.5 feet and these were perfect. I think the fit was enhanced by the velcro strap that goes across the top of your foot - it lets you get these to the perfect level of tightness without having to screw around with the laces too much. The shoe is also clearly designed for pole vaulting - from the rigidity of the sole to the placement of the spikes and the cushioning on the shoe. It makes me think these would last about as long as you'd like, especially given the limited usage. It's a minor gripe, but I wish the tool that you use to screw in the spikes was magnetic inside. The spikes are flattened on two sides so that the tool can get ahold of them, but if you don't line them up right then they fall out more easily than I'd like. If you're someone that would be taking the spikes on and off a lot then it could get annoying. Overall, no real complaints with these - 5 out of 5!",

The colors are quite appealing to the eyes, not too much or less, but definitely very noticeable. They have 6 removable spikes, my only con will be the fact that when the spikes are attached, the shoes are quite loud. Without the spikes attached, they are still very much wearable because the shoe has a plastic sole. Although they are built for jumpers, I definitely did enjoy using them to run and will continue to use them to run. Highly recommended",

I purchased these in a size 11.5 (my true size), I would consider my feet to be wide and somewhat flatfooted, not as much as KD, but for my flatfooters out there you know the struggle. I primary play on outdoor courts so I will base my review on this environment alone. First of for my heavier post and PF players this is the shoes to get if your major concern is impact protection and comfort, their A1. Good room in the toe box, no uncomfortable rubbing of my pinky toe, and good lockdown ankle stability. Break in time for these shoes was basically none and they felt good from the jump. This model is definitely a lighter low top version for those who do not like the 19's. Court feel is good and traction for outdoor use is great. Lateral movements felt stable and I had no fear of ever rolling my ankle. Since this is a premium shoe in the Nike basketball line the materials are durable and honestly quite breathable; you definitely get your moneys worth. For my big men moving bodies in the paint and grabbing boards these are a must ! Try to catch them on sale you'll thank me later.",

I love the colorways and chose to go with these specifically because they look like they'll be about the closest thing to a Kobe that you can get your hands on. I haven't played ball in them yet, but I will say, both pairs make a strange popping sound with each step. It sounds like the glue that's holding the insole in place is cracking or something. It may not impact performance at all, and nothing feels like it's loose or coming undone, but the sound alone is very annoying. The shoe is comfortable, though. It will definitely need some break in time as it's pretty stiff out of the box. Feels tough to get a good lockdown like I could with the PG5 or any of the Kobe low tops. Again, I'm guessing that will get better with break-in. The traction feels like it will be amazing on the court as well. I'm excited to see some of the additional colorways drop and hope that these will be a good, reliable hoop shoe.",

Inspired by Elena’s disabled older sister, Lizzie, the innovative Nike FlyEase design has a collapsible heel and an upper that opens wide for easy entry. Step in, press the FlyEase strap to secure and go. Elena says of the design, “The technology is really cool. It creates so much room for someone with special needs.”",

That spring and speed is enveloped in a soft injected foam for complete stability that can help you play at a high level for longer.",

Plus, a zoned traction pattern helps you nail every move in any direction.",

One of the rounds was the day after a heavy rain -- my feet stayed dry. I don't understand the purpose of the mesh covering, and it makes them a little difficult to clean. As for the band & loop that you're supposed to pull to adjust the shoe -- I can't tell that either one does anything. However, I slip in and out of the shoes easily and they don't feel tight or loose. When buying athletic shoes I always buy 1/2 size larger than my street shoes (8M), which I did with these -- they fit fine. I can't comment on durability since I've only had them a short time.",

They are lighter and more flexible than the typical tennis shoes but still feel snug and secure. I have wide feet and low arches and have a hard time finding court shoes that don't hurt my feet after an hour--I have been able to wear these without any pain at all. I like them so much that I purchased a second pair so that I don't have to look for shoes again next season. They do run quite big and I ordered a whole size down. I usually wear size 7 in Nike running shoes, but I found the 6 to be the correct size for me in these shoes. If you have wide feet and prefer lower arch support, I would recommend them.",

They’re stylish and comfy for every activity, from a shopping trip to a day at the park. I’m a women’s 6.5-7, and I usually wear a kids’ 4.5-5. Size 4.5 seems plenty spacious for me, so if you’re in between sizes then I’d select the smaller option. I’m very impressed with the quality of these shoes. I can’t wait to wear them on some more adventures!",

He has worn these shoes for all of his regular activities. He has told me they are extra comfy and loves the cool look of the shoe. My son is tall for his age, he wears a 6.5Y and has no problem getting these shoes on himself. I really like how durable the shoe is, they have been worn nonstop for 2 weeks and still look great.

The stitching is very well done and only a couple of tiny areas where you can see an overlap of glue or a stray stitch but you really have to look closely.

If you like walking on clouds and having a plushy ride with a little pep in your step then these are the shoes for you! I bought them in white so they could go with anything I wore. These are great for running and for lifestyle/fashion. If you want a comfy work shoe I would recommend the all-black version as I try and keep my white shoes looking like the shoes angels might wear if they were to grace the earth which is a chore. Additionally, the all-black at this time is only $119 which is a steal in my opinion. Hopefully, the shoes last. I am really impressed by the rubber outsole made with Continental. As I runner, I picked up on the quality and expect the outsole to last for a long time. The collar of the shoe is a bit odd in the back it is at a 60-70° angle. I will try and update this later to see how the shoes hold up. Warning: Not suitable for asceticism. Note: This shoe provides a pleasurable experience. Warning: Your feet may fall in love with you as a result of your purchase!",

Maybe I’ll try stretching these out or something. I’ll have to go to a store and try a half size up and see if that fixes it.

Went with the Pride colorway (Kris Andrew Small collection), and I absolutely love the looks. Oreo Primeknit upper with a spattering of colours to match the colourful outsole. Everything about the shoe is both subtle and in-your-face at the same time. The fit is a bit small. Even compared to other shoes in the Ultraboost line, the 5.0 DNA feels quite tight on the left and right edges of your feet, as well as around the ankle. I personally went a half-size up and found the fit much more comfortable. Speaking of comfort... The BOOST midsole provides a considerable amount of bounce and cushioning. The snug, sock-like fit of the Primeknit is light and breathable. Can't recommend this shoe enough!",

By her fist game, August 20th, the sole separated from the top of the shoe! She had to tape shoe together until we could get back to the store to purchase a different pair. This is SUCH A DISAPPOINMENT!! She loves adidas and has only worn adidas since she started playing at 5. We never had this issue with this brand before these shoes. Now reading other reviews, it seems as if this is a common problem. I know that these are not the most expensive model to buy, but barely a month of use is just sub par.",

But they kind of look like if Hello Kitty and Barbie had a LOVE child. But like I said I am torn! James Harden your in PHL now lets see a championship and can we PLEASE get similar pattern LOVE THE JH VI and the details on the shoes. But I look ridiculous! But Comfortable.

We have a clean-shoe policy since COVID in any of our common areas, so I chose these to use in the main areas of the firehouse (so that our work boots aren't tracking throughout the station). I've worn these for four days but unfortunately they've already begun to show significant wear and tear, and I am not sure if this is normal or if I happened to get a defective set. They're very comfortable, honestly the most comfortable ones I've ever owned. I wanted to buy a second pair, but I'm hesitant to do so based on how this pair has worn already.",

I tried supergluing it together, however there was no luck. It would only be fair if I was issued a full refund, as the quality is absolutely horrid. I didn't pay roughly $50 to use the sliders only 10 times.",
