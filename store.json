Made for runners, the futuristic technology was quickly adopted by the street, bringing this light-as-air feeling to the masses."

Immediately I could tell the comfort was not like other shoes, they feel incredible. I actually said 'woah!'' out loud after running my first steps! I have tried many comfort shoes from nike over the years and these are by far the best, no question. Unfortunately, I cannot wear these anymore because the shoe is very narrow, particularly around the pinky toe area. My pinky toe is pressed tight against the side of the shoe. Towards the end of my run it was in pain due to this that lasted for days. This only happened on my right foot, so I assume this is a me problem. I am a big Nike shoe person and I have never experienced this issue with any nike shoes in my lifetime. I am very bummed because I was excited to use these as my long/recovery run shoe. I am not giving up on them yet, will try and see if I can widen them somehow because that's how good they are. I also want to point out that after my single run, the fabric on the outsides of the ankle support were getting frayed and coming apart on both shoes. This is unacceptable in my opinion, I wore these for two hours!",

When it came to the Infinity React 2s I didn't enjoy them for running and resorted to using them for work and casual wear which they were fantastic for. When it came to running I resorted to the Invincible Runs last year. With the Infinity React 3s I have enjoyed the small additional foam and how its softer. These have actually prevented me from buying and keeping a pair of Invincible Runs since they are softer and bouncier and better for me when running. The top material change to a softer style which is almost sock like which is wonderful. I also like how these are durable enough for other work outs besides running and keep their look/design for casual wear and work wear. Going forward if there were any changes I would make to these its the toe area could use a little bit more foam and the collar around the ankle would be better if it was like the Infinity Phantoms collar. Looking forward to the other colorways I might be able to get to go with my two pair.",

Also very flexible almost like a Nike Free Run shoe. The boot is very comfortable and true to size. One thing that i'm not too sure about, is how thin the material is in the toe area. I feel like over time, this could be a durability issue. I also don't see how this can be a water resistant boot, but only time will tell if I am wrong. Overall this is a great boot and probably my favorite of all time. I have listed the PROS and CONS below. PROS: -Lightweight -Comfortable -True fit -Looks great -Flexible Boot (Like a Free Run almost) -Good tread CONS: -Durability in the toe area could be an issue. Time will tell. -Water Resistance questionable. Time will tell. (Cons are only based on my opinion. I have not tested this boot to the fullest and would not base your purchase on these cons. I believe overall this is a great boot. You can always return the boot within 30 days if you are not satisfied.)",

However, on the olive version the laces are different than the black canvas (which comes with waxed laces). The olive ones you HAVE to double knot them because no matter what way you tie them otherwise, they'll come untied within 5 minutes of walking around. That is my only complaint. but comfort and style wise these are on point and fit TTS.",

These sneakers are better than tying my shoes, but they're a little tough to operate if you haven't precisely put your foot on the back to get them off. Also, the toe box is too narrow for all-the-time comfort. I'm seeing them as only good for this temporary time, which is a bummer because there's lots of times where I could use an easy-in-out shoe for taking the dog around the block. Also, would love if they could create a model that works with orthotics. Overall fit is right in length but narrow in width.",

There is little give and actually gets very narrow. These can not be worn with braces, specialty socks or with wide feet. You need to have a very narrow foot. I tried them on (2 sizes smaller then the shoe size) and I could barely get my toes into and past the point where it narrows. Bummed about the sizing on these.

At first I was hopeful because there is finally an accessible sneaker specifically catered to leg braces. but, when I tried these shoes on they were the same size as a different pair I have that fit perfectly. However the length and width was very disproportionate. I could barely get it around the width of my brace and when I did there was a ton of gapping and sinking in the toe of the shoe. I hope that this comment helps Nike and other companies to modify how they make shoes. For me personally, I need shoes with a WIDE if not EXTRA WIDE width shoe. Of topic, I need the wide width and toe in boots especially. Opening the shoe is not the issue, it’s the width.",

The shoe seems to have a sweet spot when landing with a mid-foot or slightly forefoot landing.

I went to a huge music festival in Ohio this past week. Weather was super weird and some of the terrain was wet and muddy. These boots kept my feet so warm and dry. Better yet, they are SO comfortable. My feet usually tire out super quickly at festivals. By the second day it usually hurts to walk. 5 days in to a week long trek making nearly 20,000 steps a day and my feet barely hurt at all. I had unlimited energy for walking, which really allowed me to enjoy the full festival, which I’ve never been able to do before due to foot pain. These boots handle incredibly rocky and hilly terrain extremely well. Important also to note that there was no break in period. I only wore them twice before the festival. Amazing. 10/10 recommend.",

Also I bought the size I always wear for every Nike shoes I've ever purchased (9.5) and they are too big. This is opposite to what I was expecting since most reviews say they run small.

I'm an EU 36 narrow and the 6 was just snug enough to be uncomfortable after a little bit of wear. The toe split is where I felt the most discomfort, but I could feel my heel going over the insoles as well. I exchanged for a 7 and to my complete disappointment, those were way too big to be comfortable in this style. This is the kind of shoe that would be best if it fits perfectly so it feels like you're really not wearing much at all but you get the awesome benefits of the design. If they made these in half sizes I would be over the moon, they really were so close to perfect.",
