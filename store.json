Immediately I could tell the comfort was not like other shoes, they feel incredible. I actually said 'woah!'' out loud after running my first steps! I have tried many comfort shoes from nike over the years and these are by far the best, no question. Unfortunately, I cannot wear these anymore because the shoe is very narrow, particularly around the pinky toe area. My pinky toe is pressed tight against the side of the shoe. Towards the end of my run it was in pain due to this that lasted for days. This only happened on my right foot, so I assume this is a me problem. I am a big Nike shoe person and I have never experienced this issue with any nike shoes in my lifetime. I am very bummed because I was excited to use these as my long/recovery run shoe. I am not giving up on them yet, will try and see if I can widen them somehow because that's how good they are. I also want to point out that after my single run, the fabric on the outsides of the ankle support were getting frayed and coming apart on both shoes. This is unacceptable in my opinion, I wore these for two hours!",

When it came to the Infinity React 2s I didn't enjoy them for running and resorted to using them for work and casual wear which they were fantastic for. When it came to running I resorted to the Invincible Runs last year. With the Infinity React 3s I have enjoyed the small additional foam and how its softer. These have actually prevented me from buying and keeping a pair of Invincible Runs since they are softer and bouncier and better for me when running. The top material change to a softer style which is almost sock like which is wonderful. I also like how these are durable enough for other work outs besides running and keep their look/design for casual wear and work wear. Going forward if there were any changes I would make to these its the toe area could use a little bit more foam and the collar around the ankle would be better if it was like the Infinity Phantoms collar. Looking forward to the other colorways I might be able to get to go with my two pair.",

Also very flexible almost like a Nike Free Run shoe. The boot is very comfortable and true to size. One thing that i'm not too sure about, is how thin the material is in the toe area. I feel like over time, this could be a durability issue. I also don't see how this can be a water resistant boot, but only time will tell if I am wrong. Overall this is a great boot and probably my favorite of all time. I have listed the PROS and CONS below. PROS: -Lightweight -Comfortable -True fit -Looks great -Flexible Boot (Like a Free Run almost) -Good tread CONS: -Durability in the toe area could be an issue. Time will tell. -Water Resistance questionable. Time will tell. (Cons are only based on my opinion. I have not tested this boot to the fullest and would not base your purchase on these cons. I believe overall this is a great boot. You can always return the boot within 30 days if you are not satisfied.)",

However, on the olive version the laces are different than the black canvas (which comes with waxed laces). The olive ones you HAVE to double knot them because no matter what way you tie them otherwise, they'll come untied within 5 minutes of walking around. That is my only complaint. but comfort and style wise these are on point and fit TTS.",

These sneakers are better than tying my shoes, but they're a little tough to operate if you haven't precisely put your foot on the back to get them off. Also, the toe box is too narrow for all-the-time comfort. I'm seeing them as only good for this temporary time, which is a bummer because there's lots of times where I could use an easy-in-out shoe for taking the dog around the block. Also, would love if they could create a model that works with orthotics. Overall fit is right in length but narrow in width.",

There is little give and actually gets very narrow. These can not be worn with braces, specialty socks or with wide feet. You need to have a very narrow foot. I tried them on (2 sizes smaller then the shoe size) and I could barely get my toes into and past the point where it narrows. Bummed about the sizing on these.

At first I was hopeful because there is finally an accessible sneaker specifically catered to leg braces. but, when I tried these shoes on they were the same size as a different pair I have that fit perfectly. However the length and width was very disproportionate. I could barely get it around the width of my brace and when I did there was a ton of gapping and sinking in the toe of the shoe. I hope that this comment helps Nike and other companies to modify how they make shoes. For me personally, I need shoes with a WIDE if not EXTRA WIDE width shoe. Of topic, I need the wide width and toe in boots especially. Opening the shoe is not the issue, it’s the width.",

The shoe seems to have a sweet spot when landing with a mid-foot or slightly forefoot landing.

I went to a huge music festival in Ohio this past week. Weather was super weird and some of the terrain was wet and muddy. These boots kept my feet so warm and dry. Better yet, they are SO comfortable. My feet usually tire out super quickly at festivals. By the second day it usually hurts to walk. 5 days in to a week long trek making nearly 20,000 steps a day and my feet barely hurt at all. I had unlimited energy for walking, which really allowed me to enjoy the full festival, which I’ve never been able to do before due to foot pain. These boots handle incredibly rocky and hilly terrain extremely well. Important also to note that there was no break in period. I only wore them twice before the festival. Amazing. 10/10 recommend.",

I'm an EU 36 narrow and the 6 was just snug enough to be uncomfortable after a little bit of wear. The toe split is where I felt the most discomfort, but I could feel my heel going over the insoles as well. I exchanged for a 7 and to my complete disappointment, those were way too big to be comfortable in this style. This is the kind of shoe that would be best if it fits perfectly so it feels like you're really not wearing much at all but you get the awesome benefits of the design. If they made these in half sizes I would be over the moon, they really were so close to perfect.",

I did not think that it was extraordinary or anything but I did note that it was thicker than most other Nike shoes which I suppose provides slightly more comfort than other running shoes. I bought these shoes for nursing school since I needed comfortable white shoes. I did not want to buy the Pegasus line in white since I do not plan to use it past school since I do not like white shoes. Nonetheless, this shoe was definitely not fully white, but more of an eggshell off colored white. While I personally just need to fulfil dress code requirements, this did bother me as the pictures make the shoe look blinding white. Also, the side details appear to be mesh since you can see the sock color I wear through it. It is not completely see-through, but it does show the color of the sock. The shoe overall gives good stability for your foot and is comfortable to walk around it but does not feel entirely different to the Pegasus line in terms of long-wear comfort. The size it just right as my foot is a 7.5 and I gambled and ordered 7.5 and have no issues with it. If you want more toe room and wear thicker socks then it might be a good idea to size up a half size but otherwise, I find that it had correct sizing. Overall, not a bad shoe, just not the \"I'm walking on clouds\" feeling everyone else is describing.",

That is my favorite part of the shoe and there was finally a nice, rich, neon orange available (vs the pale orange).The velcro style closure adds bulk which I don't like, but what really doesn't appeal to me is the way the top of the shoe lays after its fastened. The shape is odd and uncomfortable, and the center ribbon with my personalized text looks off-centered. Comfort is just okay, the slip-on flyknits have more cushioning. I'll stick to those. It would be great if those could be customized.",

The shoe runs sightly big, but once I but a thick sock on with them they fit fine. I love how the shoe doesn’t have shoestrings that you tie up, instead a velcro strap that keeps your foot tight and snugged in the shoe. You just put your foot in and go. I’m a sprinter, it felt so good running in them and not once did the strap loosen. Also, the sole of the shoe is very thick and gives you a little height. Although the sole of the shoe is thick the shoe is very light. Even if your not a runner I would recommend these shoes as a every day shoe because of the comfort.",

The color is a highlighter yellow with blue accents. I'm not usually a fan of very brightly colored shoes but I was really into these because the color fades out towards the toes and they were just really sharp looking. The laces are a good material, not too slippery so they stay put but easy on the fingers and sleek looking to fit with the rest of the shoes style. The material is lightweight, breathable, has a little give, no seams digging in and is overall very comfortable feeling. I have another style made out of this material and they've held up really well for a few years now so I anticipate these will do the same. They feel supportive enough for running or jogging but aren't too bulky for walking or casual wear. As for fit, unfortunately they run on the small side. I typically wear an women's 8 but sometimes need an 8.5 these days. I got the woman's 8 and they were a bit too tight for me to keep. I would definitely recommend choosing a size up if you're on the upper end of your usual size or between sizes. I have ever so slightly narrow width feet and found the toe space to be pretty average. I really enjoyed these sneakers and will definitely get them in a size up.",

I have a difficult time finding running shoes that don’t slip in the heel and/or have good arch support. I have at least 5 pair of Nikes that sit in my closet, rarely worn. Enter the Nike Air Zoom Alphafly Flyknit! Holy moly these feel amazing! They have a heel no-slip pad and amazing support. I want to wear them all the time! I don’t like the color combination though - wish the mid-sole was black instead of white. It’s distracting. Because my arch is so high, it’s a challenge putting these on. I need a shoe horn. But once they are on … perfect fit.",

I always wear 8 men and 9 1/2 women. True to size. I highly recommend them. It arrived fast as usual and looks like from our local Miami store. I didn’t even have to take a drive.

I have about 75 miles on my current pair but I can tell the uppers are already more durable than the TK6 and TK7. I run on a lot of sandy trails and these keep the sand out better than my old pairs. The traction is also much improved for rocky terrain. I love these shoes for hill repeats and even long trail runs (I’ve done up to 13 miles so far). I just wish there were more colors available!",

                    "comment": "For starters, these shoes are obviously for a very specific purpose - they'll be worn for short periods of time during practice or competition, and that's about it. Because of that, I had fairly low expectations when it came to comfort, build quality, and even in how event-specific these shoes would really be. These really exceeded my expectations in all of those areas. They're incredibly well built - high quality materials, bulletproof construction, and a great, snug fit. They fit true to size - I have average width 10.5 feet and these were perfect. I think the fit was enhanced by the velcro strap that goes across the top of your foot - it lets you get these to the perfect level of tightness without having to screw around with the laces too much. The shoe is also clearly designed for pole vaulting - from the rigidity of the sole to the placement of the spikes and the cushioning on the shoe. It makes me think these would last about as long as you'd like, especially given the limited usage. It's a minor gripe, but I wish the tool that you use to screw in the spikes was magnetic inside. The spikes are flattened on two sides so that the tool can get ahold of them, but if you don't line them up right then they fall out more easily than I'd like. If you're someone that would be taking the spikes on and off a lot then it could get annoying. Overall, no real complaints with these - 5 out of 5!",

The colors are quite appealing to the eyes, not too much or less, but definitely very noticeable. They have 6 removable spikes, my only con will be the fact that when the spikes are attached, the shoes are quite loud. Without the spikes attached, they are still very much wearable because the shoe has a plastic sole. Although they are built for jumpers, I definitely did enjoy using them to run and will continue to use them to run. Highly recommended",
